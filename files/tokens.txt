went out at the gate the white plain look dead and there wa not a singl bird in the morn sky on both side of the road and in the distanc there were bluish patch of young cops yergunov began think how he would be greet at the hospit and what the doctor would say to him it wa absolut necessari to think of that and to prepar beforehand to answer question he would be ask but thi thought grew blur and slip away he walk along think of noth but lyubka of the peasant with whom he had pass the night he rememb how after lyubka struck him the second time she had bent down to the floor for the quilt and how her loos hair had fallen on the floor hi mind wa in a maze and he wonder whi there were in the world doctor hospit assist merchant clerk and peasant instead of simpl free men there are to be sure free bird free beast a free merik and they are not afraid of anyon and don t need anyon and whose idea wa it who had decre that one must get up in the morn dine at midday go to bed in the even that a doctor take preced of a hospit assist that one must live in room and love onli one s wife and whi not the contrari dine at night and sleep in the day ah to jump on a hors without enquir whose it is to

birch tree and sank into thought and hi grey monoton life hi wage hi subordin posit the dispensari the everlast to do with the bottl and blister struck him as contempt sicken who say it s a sin to enjoy oneself he ask himself with vexat those who say that have never live in freedom like merik and kalashnikov and have never love lyubka they have been beggar all their live have live without ani pleasur and have onli love their wive who are like frog and he thought about himself that he had not hitherto been a thief a swindler or even a brigand simpli becaus he could not or had not yet met with a suitabl opportun a year and a half pass in spring after easter yergunov who had long befor been dismiss from the hospit and wa hang about without a job came out of the tavern in ryepino and

how infinit the depth of the sky and with what fathomless immens it stretch over the world the world is creat well enough onli whi and with what right do peopl thought yergunov divid their fellow into the sober and the drunken the employ and the dismiss and so on whi do the sober and well fed sleep comfort in their home while the drunken and the hungri must wander about the countri without a refug whi wa it that if anyon had not a job and did not get a salari he had to go hungri without cloth and boot whose idea wa it whi wa it the bird and the wild beast in the wood did not have job and get salari but live as they pleas far away in the sky a beauti crimson glow lay quiver stretch wide over the horizon yergunov stop and for a long time he gaze at it and kept wonder whi wa it that if he had carri off someon els s samovar the day befor and sold it for drink in the tavern it would be a sin whi wa it two cart drove by on the road in one of them there wa a woman asleep in the other sat an old man without a cap on grandfath where is that fire ask yergunov andrey tchirikov s inn answer the old man and yergunov recal what had happen to him eighteen month befor in the winter in that

loathsom and horribl he spoke in a loud tenor with heat and invari either with scorn and indign or with wonder and enthusiasm and alway with perfect sincer whatev one talk to him about he alway brought it round to the same subject that life wa dull and stifl in the town that the townspeopl had no lofti interest but live a dingi meaningless life diversifi by violenc coars profligaci and hypocrisi that scoundrel were well fed and cloth while honest men live from hand to mouth that they need school a progress local paper a theatr public lectur the co ordin of the intellectu element

well educ and well read accord to the townspeopl s notion he knew everyth and wa in their eye someth like a walk encyclopedia he had read a great deal he would sit at the club nervous pull at hi beard and look through the magazin and book and from hi face one could see that he wa not read but devour the page without give himself time to digest what he read it must be suppos that read wa one of hi morbid habit as he fell upon anyth that came into hi hand with equal avid even last year s newspap and calendar at home he alway read lie down iii one autumn morn ivan dmitritch turn up the collar of hi greatcoat and splash through the mud made hi way by side street and back lane to see some artisan and to collect some payment that wa owe he wa in a gloomi mood as he alway wa in the morn in one of the side street he wa met by two convict in fetter and four soldier with rifl in charg of them ivan dmitritch had veri often met convict befor and they had alway excit feel of compass and discomfort in him but now thi meet made a peculiar strang impress on him it suddenli seem to him for some reason that he too might be put into fetter and led through the mud to prison like that after visit the artisan on the way home he met near the post offic a polic superintend of hi acquaint who greet him and walk a few pace along the street with him and for some reason thi seem to him suspici at home he could not get the convict or the soldier with their rifl out of hi head all day and an unaccount inward agit prevent him from read or concentr hi mind in the even he did not light hi lamp and at night he could not sleep but kept think that he might be arrest put into fetter and thrown into prison he did not know of ani harm he had done and could be certain that he would never be guilti of murder arson or theft in the futur either but wa it not easi to commit a crime by accid unconsci and wa not fals wit alway possibl and inde miscarriag of justic it wa not without good reason that the agelong experi of the simpl peopl teach that beggari and prison are ill none can be safe from a judici mistak is veri possibl as legal proceed are conduct nowaday and there is noth to be wonder at in it peopl who have an offici profession relat to other men s suffer for instanc judg polic offic doctor in cours of time through habit grow so callou that they cannot even if they wish it take ani but a formal attitud to their client in thi respect they are not differ from the peasant who slaughter sheep and calv in the back yard and doe not notic the blood with thi formal soulless attitud to human person the judg need but one thing time in order to depriv an innoc man of all right of properti and to condemn him to penal servitud onli the time spent on perform certain formal for which the judg is paid hi salari and then it is all over then you may look in vain for justic and protect in thi dirti wretch littl town a hundr and fifti mile from a railway station and inde is it not absurd even to think of justic when everi kind of violenc is accept by societi as a ration and consist necess and everi act of merci for instanc a verdict of acquitt call forth a perfect outburst of dissatisfi and reveng feel in the morn ivan dmitritch got up from hi bed in a state of horror with cold perspir on hi forehead complet convinc that he might be arrest ani minut sinc hi gloomi thought of yesterday had haunt him so long he thought it must be that there wa some truth in them they could not inde have come into hi mind without ani ground whatev a policeman walk slowli pass by the window that wa not for noth here were two men stand still and silent near the hous whi were they silent and agon day and night follow for ivan dmitritch everyon who pass by the window or came into the yard seem to him a spi or a detect at midday the chief of the polic usual drove down the street with a pair of hors he wa go from hi estat near the town to the polic depart but ivan dmitritch fanci everi time that he wa drive especi quickli and that he had a peculiar express it wa evid that he wa in hast to announc that there wa a veri import crimin in the town ivan dmitritch start at everi ring at the bell and knock at the gate and wa agit whenev he came upon anyon new at hi landladi s when he met polic offic and gendarm he smile and began whistl so as to seem unconcern he could not sleep for whole night in success expect to be arrest but he snore loudli and sigh as though in deep sleep that hi landladi might think he wa asleep for if he could not sleep it meant that he wa torment by the sting of conscienc what a piec of evid fact and common sens persuad him that all these terror were nonsens and morbid that if one look at the matter more broadli there wa noth realli terribl in arrest and imprison so long as the conscienc is at eas but the more sensibl and logic he reason the more acut and agon hi mental distress becam it might be compar with the stori of a hermit who tri to cut a dwell place for himself in a virgin forest the more zealous he work with hi axe the thicker the forest grew in the end ivan dmitritch see it wa useless gave up reason altogeth and abandon himself entir to despair and terror he began to avoid peopl and to seek solitud hi offici work had been distast to him befor now it becam unbear to him he wa afraid they would somehow get him into troubl would put a bribe in hi pocket unnot and then denounc him or that he would accident make a mistak in offici paper that would appear to be fraudul or would lose other peopl s money it is strang that hi imagin had never at other time been so agil and invent as now when everi day he thought of thousand of differ reason for be serious anxiou over hi freedom and honour but on the other hand hi interest in the outer world in book in particular grew sensibl fainter and hi memori began to fail him in the spring when the snow melt there were found in the ravin near the cemeteri two half decompos corps the bodi of an old woman and a boy bear the trace of death by violenc noth wa talk of but these bodi and their unknown murder that peopl might not think he had been guilti of the crime ivan dmitritch walk about the street smile and when he met acquaint he turn pale flush and began declar that there wa no greater crime than the murder of the weak and defenceless but thi duplic soon exhaust him and after some reflect he decid that in hi posit the best thing to do wa to hide in hi landladi s cellar he sat in the cellar all day and then all night then anoth day wa fear cold and wait till dusk stole secretli like a thief back to hi room he stood in the middl of the room till daybreak listen without stir veri earli in the morn befor sunris some workmen came into the hous ivan dmitritch knew perfectli well that they had come to mend the stove in the kitchen but terror told him that they were polic offic disguis as workmen he slip stealthili out of the flat and overcom by terror ran along the street without hi cap and coat dog race after him bark a peasant shout somewher behind him the wind whistl in hi ear and it seem to ivan dmitritch that the forc and violenc of the whole world wa mass togeth behind hi back and wa chase after him he wa stop and brought home and hi landladi sent for a doctor doctor andrey yefimitch of whom we shall have more to say hereaft prescrib cold compress on hi head and laurel drop shook hi head and went away tell the landladi he should not come again as one should not interfer with peopl who are go out of their mind as he had not the mean to live at home and be nurs ivan dmitritch wa soon sent to the hospit and wa there put into the ward for vener patient he could not sleep at night wa full of whim and fanci and disturb the patient and wa soon afterward by andrey yefimitch s order transfer to ward no 6 within a year ivan dmitritch wa complet forgotten in the town and hi book heap up by hi landladi in a sledg in the shed were pull to piec by boy iv ivan dmitritch s neighbour on the left hand is as i have said alreadi the jew moiseika hi neighbour on the right hand is a peasant so roll in fat that he is almost spheric with a blankli stupid face utterli devoid of thought thi is a motionless glutton unclean anim who ha long ago lost all power of thought or feel an acrid stifl stench alway come from him nikita who ha to clean up after him beat him terribl with all hi might not spare hi fist and what is dread is not hi be beaten that one can get use to but the fact that thi stupefi creatur doe not respond to the blow with a sound or a movement nor by a look in the eye but onli sway a littl like a heavi barrel the fifth and last inhabit of ward no 6 is a man of the artisan class who had onc been a sorter in the post offic a thinnish fair littl man with a good natur but rather sli face to judg from the clear cheer look in hi calm and intellig eye he ha some pleasant idea in hi mind and ha some veri import and agreeabl secret he ha under hi pillow and under hi mattress someth that he never show anyon not from fear of it be taken from him and stolen but from modesti sometim he goe to the window and turn hi back to hi companion put someth on hi breast and bend hi head look at it if you go up to him at such a moment he is overcom with confus and snatch someth off hi breast but it is not difficult to guess hi secret congratul me he often say to ivan dmitritch i have been present with the stanislav order of the second degre with the star the second degre with the star is onli given to foreign but for some reason they want to make an except for me he say with a smile shrug hi shoulder in perplex that i must confess i did not expect i don t understand anyth about that ivan dmitritch repli moros but do you know what i shall attain to sooner or later the former sorter persist screw up hi eye slyli i shall certainli get the swedish polar star that s an order it is worth work for a white cross with a black ribbon it s veri beauti probabl in no other place is life so monoton as in thi ward in the morn the patient except the paralyt and the fat peasant wash in the entri at a big tab and wipe themselv with the skirt of their dress gown after that they drink tea out of tin mug which nikita bring them out of the main build everyon is allow one mug at midday they have soup made out of sour cabbag and boil grain in the even their supper consist of grain left from dinner in the interv they lie down sleep look out of window and walk from one corner to the other and so everi day even the former sorter alway talk of the same order fresh face are rare seen in ward no 6 the doctor ha not taken in ani new mental case for a long time and the peopl who are fond of visit lunat asylum are few in thi world onc everi two month semyon lazaritch the barber appear in the ward how he cut the patient hair and how nikita help him to do it and what a trepid the lunat are alway thrown into by the arriv of the drunken smile barber we will not describ no one even look into the ward except the barber the patient are condemn to see day after day no one but nikita a rather strang rumour ha howev been circul in the hospit of late it is rumour that the doctor ha begun to visit ward no 6 v a strang rumour dr andrey yefimitch ragin is a strang man in hi way they say that when he wa young he wa veri religi and prepar himself for a cleric career and that when he had finish hi studi at the high school in 1863 he intend to enter a theolog academi but that hi father a surgeon and doctor of medicin jeer at him and declar point blank that he would disown him if he becam a priest how far thi is true i don t know but andrey yefimitch himself ha more than onc confess that he ha never had a natur bent for medicin or scienc in gener howev that may have been when he finish hi studi in the medic faculti he did not enter the priesthood he show no special devout and wa no more like a priest at the begin of hi medic career than he is now hi exterior is heavi coars like a peasant s hi face hi beard hi flat hair and hi coars clumsi figur suggest an overf intemper and harsh innkeep on the highroad hi face is surli look and cover with blue vein hi eye are littl and hi nose is red with hi height and broad shoulder he ha huge hand and feet one would think that a blow from hi fist would knock the life out of anyon but hi step is soft and hi walk is cautiou and insinu when he meet anyon in a narrow passag he is alway the first to stop and make way and to say not in a bass as one would expect but in a high soft tenor i beg your pardon he ha a littl swell on hi neck which prevent him from wear stiff starch collar and so he alway goe about in soft linen or cotton shirt altogeth he doe not dress like a doctor he wear the same suit for ten year and the new cloth which he usual buy at a jewish shop look as shabbi and crumpl on him as hi old one he see patient and dine and pay visit all in the same coat but thi is not due to niggardli but to complet careless about hi appear when andrey yefimitch came to the town to take up hi duti the institut found to the glori of god wa in a terribl condit one could hardli breath for the stench in the ward in the passag and in the courtyard of the hospit the hospit servant the nurs and their children slept in the ward togeth with the patient they complain that there wa no live for beetl bug and mice the surgic ward were never free from erysipela there were onli two scalpel and not one thermomet in the whole hospit potato were kept in the bath the superintend the housekeep and the medic assist rob the patient and of the old doctor andrey yefimitch s predecessor peopl declar that he secretli sold the hospit alcohol and that he kept a regular harem consist of nurs and femal patient these disorderli proceed were perfectli well known in the town and were even exagger but peopl took them calmli some justifi them on the ground that there were onli peasant and work men in the hospit who could not be dissatisfi sinc they were much wors off at home than in the hospit they couldn t be fed on woodcock other said in excus that the town alon without help from the zemstvo wa not equal to maintain a good hospit thank god for have one at all even a poor one and the newli form zemstvo did not open infirmari either in the town or the neighbourhood reli on the fact that the town alreadi had it hospit after look over the hospit andrey yefimitch came to the conclus that it wa an immor institut and extrem prejudici to the health of the townspeopl in hi opinion the most sensibl thing that could be done wa to let out the patient and close the hospit but he reflect that hi will alon wa not enough to do thi and that it would be useless if physic and moral impur were driven out of one place they would onli move to anoth one must wait for it to wither away of itself besid if peopl open a hospit and put up with have it it must be becaus they need it superstit and all the nasti and abomin of daili life were necessari sinc in process of time they work out to someth sensibl just as manur turn into black earth there wa noth on earth so good that it had not someth nasti about it first origin when andrey yefimitch undertook hi duti he wa appar not greatli concern about the irregular at the hospit he onli ask the attend and nurs not to sleep in the ward and had two cupboard of instrument put up the superintend the housekeep the medic assist and the erysipela remain unchang andrey yefimitch love intellig and honesti intens but he had no strength of will nor belief in hi right to organ an intellig and honest life about him he wa absolut unabl to give order to forbid thing and to insist it seem as though he had taken a vow never to rais hi voic and never to make use of the imper it wa difficult for him to say fetch or bring when he want hi meal he would cough hesitatingli and say to the cook how about tea or how about dinner to dismiss the superintend or to tell him to leav off steal or to abolish the unnecessari parasit post altogeth wa absolut beyond hi power when andrey yefimitch wa deceiv or flatter or account he knew to be cook were brought him to sign he would turn as red as a crab and feel guilti but yet he would sign the account when the patient complain to him of be hungri or of the rough of the nurs he would be confus and mutter guiltili veri well veri well i will go into it later most like there is some misunderstand at first andrey yefimitch work veri zealous he saw patient everi day from morn till dinner time perform oper and even attend confin the ladi said of him that he wa attent and clever at diagnos diseas especi those of women and children but in process of time the work unmistak weari him by it monotoni and obviou useless to day one see thirti patient and to morrow they have increas to thirti five the next day forti and so on from day to day from year to year while the mortal in the town did not decreas and the patient did not leav off come to be ani real help to forti patient between morn and dinner wa not physic possibl so it could but lead to decept if twelv thousand patient were seen in a year it meant if one look at it simpli that twelv thousand men were deceiv to put those who were serious ill into ward and to treat them accord to the principl of scienc wa imposs too becaus though there were principl there wa no scienc if he were to put asid philosophi and pedant follow the rule as other doctor did the thing abov all necessari were cleanli and ventil instead of dirt wholesom nourish instead of broth made of stink sour cabbag and good assist instead of thiev and inde whi hinder peopl die if death is the normal and legitim end of everyon what is gain if some shop keeper or clerk live an extra five or ten year if the aim of medicin is by drug to allevi suffer the question forc itself on one whi allevi it in the first place they say that suffer lead man to perfect and in the second if mankind realli learn to allevi it suffer with pill and drop it will complet abandon religion and philosophi in which it ha hitherto found not mere protect from all sort of troubl but even happi pushkin suffer terribl agoni befor hi death poor hein lay paralyz for sever year whi then should not some andrey yefimitch or matryona savishna be ill sinc their live had noth of import in them and would have been entir empti and like the life of an amoeba except for suffer oppress by such reflect andrey yefimitch relax hi effort and gave up visit the hospit everi day vi hi life wa pass like thi as a rule he got up at eight o clock in the morn dress and drank hi tea then he sat down in hi studi to read or went to the hospit at the hospit the out patient were sit in the dark narrow littl corridor wait to be seen by the doctor the nurs and the attend tramp with their boot over the brick floor ran by them gaunt look patient in dress gown pass dead bodi and vessel full of filth were carri by the children were cri and there wa a cold draught andrey yefimitch knew that such surround were tortur to feverish consumpt and impression patient but what could be done in the consult room he wa met by hi assist sergey sergeyitch a fat littl man with a plump well wash shaven face with soft smooth manner wear a new loos cut suit and look more like a senat than a medic assist he had an immens practic in the town wore a white tie and consid himself more profici than the doctor who had no practic in the corner of the consult room there stood a larg ikon in a shrine with a heavi lamp in front of it and near it a candl stand with a white cover on it on the wall hung portrait of bishop a view of the svyatogorski monasteri and wreath of dri cornflow sergey sergeyitch wa religi and like solemn and decorum the ikon had been put up at hi expens at hi instruct some one of the patient read the hymn of prais in the consult room on sunday and after the read sergey sergeyitch himself went through the ward with a censer and burn incens there were a great mani patient but the time wa short and so the work wa confin to the ask of a few brief question and the administr of some drug such as castor oil or volatil ointment andrey yefimitch would sit with hi cheek rest in hi hand lost in thought and ask question mechan sergey sergeyitch sat down too rub hi hand and from time to time put in hi word we suffer pain and poverti he would say becaus we do not pray to the merci god as we should ye andrey yefimitch never perform ani oper when he wa see patient he had long ago given up do so and the sight of blood upset him when he had to open a child s mouth in order to look at it throat and the child cri and tri to defend itself with it littl hand the nois in hi ear made hi head go round and brought tear to hi eye he would make hast to prescrib a drug and motion to the woman to take the child away he wa soon weari by the timid of the patient and their incoher by the proxim of the piou sergey sergeyitch by the portrait on the wall and by hi own question which he had ask over and over again for twenti year and he would go away after see five or six patient the rest would be seen by hi assist in hi absenc with the agreeabl thought that thank god he had no privat practic now and that no one would interrupt him andrey yefimitch sat down to the tabl immedi on reach home and took up a book he read a great deal and alway with enjoy half hi salari went on buy book and of the six room that made up hi abod three were heap up with book and old magazin he like best of all work on histori and philosophi the onli medic public to which he subscrib wa the doctor of which he alway read the last page first he would alway go on read for sever hour without a break and without be weari he did not read as rapidli and impuls as ivan dmitritch had done in the past but slowli and with concentr often paus over a passag which he like or did not find intellig near the book there alway stood a decant of vodka and a salt cucumb or a pickl appl lay besid it not on a plate but on the baiz tabl cloth everi half hour he would pour himself out a glass of vodka and drink it without take hi eye off the book then without look at it he would feel for the cucumb and bite off a bit at three o clock he would go cautious to the kitchen door cough and say daryushka what about dinner after hi dinner a rather poor and untidili serv one andrey yefimitch would walk up and down hi room with hi arm fold think the clock would strike four then five and still he would be walk up and down think occasion the kitchen door would creak and the red and sleepi face of daryushka would appear andrey yefimitch isn t it time for you to have your beer she would ask anxious no it s not time yet he would answer i ll wait a littl i ll wait a littl toward the even the postmast mihail averyanitch the onli man in town whose societi did not bore andrey yefimitch would come in mihail averyanitch had onc been a veri rich landown and had serv in the calvari but had come to ruin and wa forc by poverti to take a job in the post offic late in life he had a hale and hearti appear luxuri grey whisker the manner of a well bred man and a loud pleasant voic he wa good natur and emot but hot temper when anyon in the post offic made a protest express disagr or even began to argu mihail averyanitch would turn crimson shake all over and shout in a voic of thunder hold your tongu so that the post offic had long enjoy the reput of an institut which it wa terribl to visit mihail averyanitch like and respect andrey yefimitch for hi cultur and the lofti of hi soul he treat the other inhabit of the town supercili as though they were hi subordin here i am he would say go in to andrey yefimitch good even my dear fellow i ll be bound you are get sick of me aren t you on the contrari i am delight said the doctor i am alway glad to see you the friend would sit on the sofa in the studi and for some time would smoke in silenc daryushka what about the beer andrey yefimitch would say they would drink their first bottl still in silenc the doctor brood and mihail averyanitch with a gay and anim face like a man who ha someth veri interest to tell the doctor wa alway the one to begin the convers what a piti he would say quietli and slowli not look hi friend in the face he never look anyon in the face what a great piti it is that there are no peopl in our town who are capabl of carri on intellig and interest convers or care to do so it is an immens privat for us even the educ class do not rise abov vulgar the level of their develop i assur you is not a bit higher than that of the lower order perfectli true i agre you know of cours the doctor went on quietli and deliber that everyth in thi world is insignific and uninterest except the higher spiritu manifest of the human mind intellect draw a sharp line between the anim and man suggest the divin of the latter and to some extent even

told noth or he is told absurd he knock and it is not open to him death come to him also without hi choic and so just as in prison men held togeth by common misfortun feel more at eas when they are togeth so one doe not notic the trap in life when peopl with a bent for analysi and gener meet togeth and pass their time in the interchang of proud and free idea in that sens the intellect is the

the transmut of substanc but what cowardic to comfort oneself with that cheap substitut for immort the unconsci process that take place in natur are lower even than the stupid of man sinc in stupid there is anyway conscious and will while in those process there is absolut noth onli the coward who ha more fear of death than digniti can comfort himself with the fact that hi bodi will in time live again in the grass in the stone in the toad to find one s immort in the transmut of substanc is as strang as to prophesi a brilliant futur for the case after a preciou violin ha been broken and becom useless when the clock struck andrey yefimitch would sink back into hi chair and close hi eye to think a littl and under the influenc of the fine idea of which he had been read he would unawar recal

elboru in comparison with what had been in the past they no longer pour cold water on the head of lunat nor put strait waistcoat upon them they treat them with human and even so it wa state in the paper got up ball and entertain for them andrey yefimitch knew that with modern tast and view such an abomin as ward no 6 wa possibl onli a hundr and fifti mile from a railway in a littl town where the mayor and all the town council were half illiter tradesmen who look upon the doctor as an oracl who must be believ without ani critic even if he had pour molten lead into their mouth in ani other

i have been live here i do believ he is the first i have met with whom one can talk he is capabl of reason and is interest in just the right thing while he wa read and afterward while he wa go to bed he kept think about ivan dmitritch and when he woke next morn he rememb that he had the day befor made the acquaint of an intellig and interest man and determin to visit him again as soon as possibl x ivan dmitritch wa lie in the same posit as on the previou day with hi head clutch in both hand and hi leg drawn up hi face wa not visibl good day my friend said andrey yefimitch you are not asleep are you in the first place i am not your friend ivan dmitritch articul into the pillow and in the second your effort are useless you will not get one word out of me strang mutter andrey yefimitch in confus yesterday we talk peac but suddenli for some reason you took offenc and broke off all at onc probabl i express myself awkwardli or perhap gave utter to some idea which did not fit in with your convict ye a like idea said ivan dmitritch sit up and look at the doctor with ironi and uneasi hi eye were red you can go and spi and probe somewher els it s no use your do it here i knew yesterday what you had come for a strang fanci laugh the doctor so you suppos me to be a spi ye i do a spi or a doctor who ha been charg to test me it s all the same oh excus me what a queer fellow you are realli the doctor sat down on the stool near the bed and shook hi head reproach but let us suppos you are right he said let us suppos that i am treacher tri to trap you into say someth so as to betray you to the polic you would be arrest and then tri but would you be ani wors off be tri and in prison than you are here if you are banish to a settlement or even sent to penal servitud would it be wors than be shut up in thi ward i imagin it would be no wors what then are you afraid of these word evid had an effect on ivan dmitritch he sat down quietli it wa between four and five in the afternoon the time when andrey yefimitch usual walk up and down hi room and daryushka ask whether it wa not time for hi beer it wa a still bright day i came out for a walk after dinner and here i have come as you see said the doctor it is quit spring what month is it march ask ivan dmitritch ye the end of march is it veri muddi no not veri there are alreadi path in the garden it would be nice now to drive in an open carriag somewher into the countri said ivan dmitritch rub hi red eye as though he were just awak then to come home to a warm snug studi and and to have a decent doctor to cure one s headach it s so long sinc i have live like a human be it s disgust here insuffer disgust after hi excit of the previou day he wa exhaust and listless and spoke unwillingli hi finger twitch and from hi face it could be seen that he had a split headach there is no real differ between a warm snug studi and thi ward said andrey yefimitch a man s peac and content do not lie outsid a man but in himself what do you mean the ordinari man look for good and evil in extern thing that is in carriag in studi but a think man look for it in himself you should go and preach that philosophi in greec where it s warm and fragrant with the scent of pomegran but here it is not suit to the climat with whom wa it i wa talk of diogen wa it with you ye with me yesterday diogen did not need a studi or a warm habit it s hot there without you can lie in your tub and eat orang and oliv but bring him to russia to live he d be beg to be let indoor in may let alon decemb he d be doubl up with the cold no one can be insens to cold as to everi other pain marcu aureliu say a pain is a vivid idea of pain make an effort of will to chang that idea dismiss it ceas to complain and the pain will disappear that is true the wise man or simpli the reflect thought man is distinguish precis by hi contempt for suffer he is alway content and surpris at noth then i am an idiot sinc i suffer and am discont and surpris at the base of mankind you are wrong in that if you will reflect more on the subject you will understand how insignific is all that extern world that agit us one must strive for the comprehens of life and in that is true happi comprehens repeat ivan dmitritch frown extern intern excus me but i don t understand it i onli know he said get up and look angrili at the doctor i onli know that god ha creat me of warm blood and nerv ye inde if organ tissu is capabl of life it must react to everi stimulu and i do to pain i respond with tear and outcri to base with indign to filth with loath to my mind that is just what is call life the lower the organ the less sensit it is and the more feebli it react to stimulu and the higher it is the more respons and vigor it react to realiti how is it you don t know that a doctor and not know such trifl to despis suffer to be alway content and to be surpris at noth one must reach thi condit and ivan dmitritch point to the peasant who wa a mass of fat or to harden oneself by suffer to such a point that one lose all sensibl to it that is in other word to ceas to live you must excus me i am not a sage or a philosoph ivan dmitritch continu with irrit and i don t understand anyth about it i am not capabl of reason on the contrari your reason is excel the stoic whom you are parodi were remark peopl but their doctrin crystal two thousand year ago and ha not advanc and will not advanc an inch forward sinc it is not practic or live it had a success onli with the minor which spend it life in savour all sort of theori and rumin over them the major did not understand it a doctrin which advoc indiffer to wealth and to the comfort of life and a contempt for suffer and death is quit unintellig to the vast major of men sinc that major ha never known wealth or the comfort of life and to despis suffer would mean to it despis life itself sinc the whole exist of man is made up of the sensat of hunger cold injuri and a hamlet like dread of death the whole of life lie in these sensat one may be oppress by it one may hate it but one cannot despis it ye so i repeat the doctrin of the stoic can never have a futur from the begin of time up to to day you see continu increas the struggl the sensibl to pain the capac of respond to stimulu ivan dmitritch suddenli lost the thread of hi thought stop and rub hi forehead with vexat i meant to say someth import but i have lost it he said what wa i say oh ye thi is what i mean one of the stoic sold himself into slaveri to redeem hi neighbour so you see even a stoic did react to stimulu sinc for such a gener act as the destruct of oneself for the sake of one s neighbour he must have had a soul capabl of piti and indign here in prison i have forgotten everyth i have learn or els i could have recal someth els take christ for instanc christ respond to realiti by weep smile be sorrow and move to wrath even overcom by miseri he did not go to meet hi suffer with a smile he did not despis death but pray in the garden of gethseman that thi cup might pass him by ivan dmitritch laugh and sat down grant that a man s peac and content lie not outsid but in himself he said grant that one must despis suffer and not be surpris at anyth yet on what ground do you preach the theori are you a sage a philosoph no i am not a philosoph but everyon ought to preach it becaus it is reason no i want to know how it is that you consid yourself compet to judg of comprehens contempt for suffer and so on have you ever suffer have you ani idea of suffer allow me to ask you were you ever thrash in your childhood no my parent had an avers for corpor punish my father use to flog me cruelli my father wa a harsh sickli govern clerk with a long nose and a yellow neck but let us talk of you no one ha laid a finger on you all your life no one ha scare you nor beaten you you are as strong as a bull you grew up under your father s wing and studi at hi expens and then you drop at onc into a sinecur for more than twenti year you have live rent free with heat light and servic all provid and had the right to work how you pleas and as much as you pleas even to do noth you were natur a flabbi lazi man and so you have tri to arrang your life so that noth should disturb you or make you move you have hand over your work to the assist and the rest of the rabbl while you sit in peac and warmth save money read amus yourself with reflect with all sort of lofti nonsens and ivan dmitritch look at the doctor s red nose with booz in fact you have seen noth of life you know absolut noth of it and are onli theoret acquaint with realiti you despis suffer and are surpris at noth for a veri simpl reason vaniti of vaniti the extern and the intern contempt for life for suffer and for death comprehens true happi that s the philosophi that suit the russian sluggard best you see a peasant beat hi wife for instanc whi interfer let him beat her they will both die sooner or later anyway and besid he who beat injur by hi blow not the person he is beat but himself to get drunk is stupid and unseemli but if you drink you die and if you don t drink you die a peasant woman come with toothach well what of it pain is the idea of pain and besid there is no live in thi world without ill we shall all die and so go away woman don t hinder me from think and drink vodka a young man ask advic what he is to do how he is to live anyon els would think befor answer but you have got the answer readi strive for comprehens or for true happi and what is that fantast true happi there s no answer of cours we are kept here behind bar window tortur left to rot but that is veri good and reason becaus there is no differ at all between thi ward and a warm snug studi a conveni philosophi you can do noth and your conscienc is clear and you feel you are wise no sir it is not philosophi it s not think it s not breadth of vision but lazi fakir drowsi stupefact ye cri ivan dmitritch get angri again you despis suffer but i ll be bound if you pinch your finger in the door you will howl at the top of your voic and perhap i shouldn t howl said andrey yefimitch with a gentl smile oh i dare say well if you had a stroke of paralysi or suppos some fool or bulli took advantag of hi posit and rank to insult you in public and if you knew he could do it with impun then you would understand what it mean to put peopl off with comprehens and true happi that s origin said andrey yefimitch laugh with pleasur and rub hi hand i am agreeabl struck by your inclin for draw gener and the sketch of my charact you have just drawn is simpli brilliant i must confess that talk to you give me great pleasur well i ve listen to you and now you must gracious listen to me xi the convers went on for about an hour longer and appar made a deep impress on andrey yefimitch he began go to the ward everi day he went there in the morn and after dinner and often the dusk of even found him in convers with ivan dmitritch at first ivan dmitritch held aloof from him suspect him of evil design and openli express hi hostil but afterward he got use to him and hi abrupt manner chang to one of condescend ironi soon it wa all over the hospit that the doctor

there he wa told that the old doctor had gone to see the mental patient go into the lodg and stop in the entri hobotov heard the follow convers we shall never agre and you will not succeed in convert me to your faith ivan dmitritch wa say irrit you are utterli ignor of realiti and you have never known suffer but have onli like a leech fed besid the suffer of other while i have been in continu suffer from the day of my birth till to day for that reason i tell you frankli i consid myself superior to you and more compet in everi respect it s not for you to teach me i have absolut no ambit to convert you to my faith said andrey yefimitch gentli and with regret that the other refus to understand him and that is not what matter my friend what matter is not that you have suffer and i have not joy and suffer are pass let us leav them never mind them what matter is that you and i think we see in each other peopl who are capabl of think and reason and that is a common bond between us howev differ our view if you knew my friend how sick i am of the univers senseless ineptitud stupid and with what delight i alway talk with you you are an intellig man and i enjoy your compani hobotov open the door an inch and glanc into the ward ivan dmitritch in hi night cap and the doctor andrey yefimitch were sit side by side on the bed the madman wa grimac twitch and convuls wrap himself in hi gown while the doctor sat motionless with bow head and hi face wa red and look helpless and sorrow hobotov shrug hi shoulder grin and glanc at nikita nikita shrug hi shoulder too next day hobotov went to

sergey sergeyitch scrupul avoid the puddl that he might not muddi hi polish boot i must own honour yevgeni fyodoritch i have been expect it for a long time xii after thi andrey yefimitch began to notic a mysteri air in all around him the attend the nurs and the patient look at him inquisit when they met him and then whisper togeth the superintend s littl daughter masha whom he like to meet in the hospit garden for some reason ran away from him now when he went up with a smile to stroke her on the head the postmast no longer said perfectli true as he listen to him but in unaccount confus mutter ye ye ye and look at him with a griev and thought express for some reason he took to advis hi friend to give up vodka and beer but as a man of delic feel he did not say thi directli but hint it

her husband on one occas with a ladi she soon forgav him howev and which came first her husband s infidel or her idea of die the examin magistr look attent at the doctor as though he were tri to imagin whi he put that question excus me he said not quit immedi let me tri and rememb the examin magistr took off hi hat and rub hi forehead ye ye it wa veri shortli after that incid that she began talk of death ye ye well there do you see in all probabl it wa at that time that she made up her mind to poison herself but as most like she did not want to kill her child also she put it off till after her confin not like not like it s imposs she forgav him at the time that she forgav it quickli mean that she had someth bad in her mind young wive do not forgiv quickli the examin magistr gave a

wa said about it peopl don t die without a reason said the doctor that is so of cours but all the same i cannot admit that she poison herself but it is strang that the idea ha never struck me befor and no one thought of it everyon wa astonish that her predict had come to pass and the idea of such a death wa far from their mind and inde it cannot be that she poison herself no the examin magistr ponder the thought of the woman who had die so strang haunt him all through the inquest as he note down what the doctor dictat to him he move hi eyebrow gloomili and rub hi forehead and are there realli poison that kill one in a quarter of an hour gradual without ani pain he ask the doctor while the latter wa open the skull ye there are morphia for instanc h m strang i rememb she use to keep

white or that ivanov is guilti to struggl with that convict and to vanquish it is beyond the power of ani demosthen who can convinc me that i have a red moustach when i know that it is black as i listen to an orat i may perhap grow sentiment and weep but my fundament convict base for the most part on unmistak evid and fact is not chang in the least my lawyer maintain that i wa young and

syren and so on all histori consist of similar exampl and in life they are met with at everi turn and so it is bound to be or the intellig and talent man would have no superior over the stupid and incompet i stuck to my point and went on maintain that convict are stronger than ani talent though frankli speak i could not have defin exactli what i meant by convict or what i meant by talent most like i simpli talk for the sake of talk take you for exampl said the lawyer you are convinc at thi moment that your fianc e is an angel and that there is not a man in the whole town happier than you but i tell you ten or twenti minut would be enough for me to make you sit down to thi tabl and write to your fianc e break off your engag i laugh don t laugh i am speak serious said my friend if i

you off a regular string of word about a woman s eyelash or her littl finger i listen to him with relish i have seen a great mani women in my day he said but i give you my word of honour i speak as a friend your natasha andreyevna is a pearl a rare girl of cours she ha her defect mani of them in fact if you like but still she is fascin and the lawyer began talk of my fianc e s defect now i understand veri well that he wa talk of women in gener of their weak point in gener but at the time it seem to me that he wa talk onli of natasha he went into ecstasi over her turn up nose her shriek her shrill laugh her air and grace precis all the thing i so dislik in her all that wa to hi think infinit sweet grace and feminin without my notic it he quickli pass from hi enthusiast tone to one of fatherli admonit and then to a light and deris one there wa no presid judg and no one to check the diffus of the lawyer i had not time to open my mouth besid what could i say what my friend said wa not new it wa what everyon ha known for age and the whole venom lay not in what he said but in the damnabl form he put it in it realli wa beyond anyth as i listen to him then i learn that the same
